# altv-lua-module
Keep in mind that this module is still WIP (so it should lack some of the functions) and its in beta phase. If you find a bug or missing a function which you think it would be awesome to exists don't hesitate just open an issue for it. The structure and function names are equal to the JavaScript module.
If you have questions feel free to ask on [alt:V's Discord](https://discord.gg/q3zUUEC) channel (#lua).

I would like to thank [Stuyk](https://github.com/Stuyk) for its [Boilerplate](https://github.com/Stuyk/AltV-JS-Boilerplate) written in JavaScript which is ported to Lua as a good example.
